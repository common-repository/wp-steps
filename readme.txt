2. This is how a setup may look.

== Usage ==
In Editor Codeview you see a button named `wpsteps`. If you press this button it will insert the shortcode:
[wpsteps step="" last="0" goback="0" gobacktxt="" gonexttxt="" buttonclass="btn btn-default"]your content[/wpsteps]

* **step:** here you enter the stepnumber (for example 1)
* **last:** if you enter nothing there will be a `next` button, if you enter a 1 there will be no button.
* **goback:** 0 = no go back button | 1 = there will be a go back button
* **gobacktxt:** here you can enter your own go back button text
* **gonexttxt:** here you can enter your own go next button text
* **buttonclass:** enter your own buttonclass
* **`your content`** can be everything: part of a form, text, more shortcodes, images... simply everthing you need ;)
